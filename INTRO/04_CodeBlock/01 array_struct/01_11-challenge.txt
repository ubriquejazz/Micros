Challenge 1 
-----------

The array has four elements, four structures. You are to display the four structures, then you're to swap two elements in the array, and then display the four structures again. 

Now, to pull off this challenge, you'll need to define two structures. The first is a person structure. It contains two fields, a character array name, which is a string of 32 characters, and a second field, date, which is called tookoffice. This structure has three integer fields, month, day, and year. 

What you're cobbling together here is this data, the four US presidents who appear on the Mount Rushmore monument, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt, along with the date they took office

Again, the code you create to solve this challenge takes the data provided, which I'll show again, and it puts it into an array of person structures named president. The code then displays the list, it swaps the second and third elements in the array, and then displays the array's elements again. And for your reference, here is sample output for my solution, though your solution need not look exactly like this. And here's that data again. 

This challenge should take you at least 20 minutes to complete.
