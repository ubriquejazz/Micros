Challenge 5
-----------

Your challenge is to write your own lotto number drawing program. This code has four parts. First comes initialization, second, pulling the lotto numbers, third, sort the winning numbers lowest to highest, and fourth, display the results. 

Now, for the details. 

Set the number of lotto balls to 51. This value indicates the range of numbers from one to 51. 
Set the number of balls to draw at six, so the winning numbers will be in the range of one to 51, and there will be six of them. Example

	1 51 32 1 21 15

Here are some hints to help you. 

	Devise a way to keep track of the lotto numbers drawn. That way, you don't accidentally draw the same number multiple times. 

	Use array, no pointers, while you can use pointers to help keep track of the numbers

	Setting constant expressions for the number of balls (51) and the number to draw (6). 

This challenge can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
