Challenge 4
-----------

This challenge is quite involved, but in the big picture you have three overall tasks: 

1. prompt the user for a pathname, a directory to read; 
2. open that directory and read its full list of files; 
3. output that list to a file named filelist.txt. 

Here are some suggestions. 

	Strip out the \n character from user input. Valid pathnames do not contain a newline character. 

	chdir function returns zero upon success. This result is how you can both change to a given directory and validate pathname input. 

 	filelist.txt file must be created in the same directory as the program you create, if the program runs in one directory, that's the same directory in which the filelist.txt file must be created. 

This challenge can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
