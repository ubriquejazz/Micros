Challenge 2
-----------

It's a single program with three parts: 1. fetch string input from the user. 
2. process that input, mixing it with a string literal to generate a phrase 
3. output the phrase. 

In the first part, you're writing your own text input function:
- Prompt the user to type their name. 
- Write a loop that processes those characters, storing them in a buffer called 'name'
- The buffer should hold 32 characters

For part two, you copy the 'name' array into a second character buffer called 'buffer'. 
Then you take the text from the 'last' array and append it to text stored in the buffer. 
Now the 'last' array is a string literal and it contains the text "passed the challenge". 

For the final part you output the contents of the character array buffer. 
- don't use the puts or printf function to output the text. 
- write a loop that uses the putchar function to output the contents of the buffer. 

Now here's an example of how the code would run. 

	What is your name? Juan
	Juan Gago passed the challenge!

	So the results should look something like this with whatever you typed as the name appearing first.

This challenge should take you at least 20 minutes to complete.
