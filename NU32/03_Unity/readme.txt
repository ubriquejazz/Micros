# Experiences with the PIC32MZ families

## common

State machines for the interfaces: 1wire, pwm, etc. 

## external

The commands have been unit-tested by using Unity (http://www.throwtheswitch.org)

## cross platform

Some E&R routines are available at the pylib folder (under construction). The idea is to code them in Embedded C (XC32) and test them in Python (pytest)
